Spoilers for Minigame Investigator - please do not share any information on the story of Minigame Investigator that you find here but not in the builds on GameJolt, but if you have any doubts, you can DM me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/JK0JK_) or send me an e-mail (thejkgameplays@gmail.com)

This is the repository of all the changes Minigame Investigator has gone through since we started using the decomp verison of Pokemon Emerald. This is both for archiving, salvaging and academic purposes only and should not be distributed as a sole product.

Final release builds and patches are distributed on GameJolt: https://gamejolt.com/games/minigameinvestigator/640300

##FAQ
1. Why is this repo public?
We want to keep the project open source, before, during, and after production. That is because we endorse mods, both graphical, sound, or otherwise. Make a pull request for your own Minigame Investigator mods! We will be looking into every one of them!
We are also aware that JK's coding skills can sometimes be lacking. That's why keeping the repo public is also important for code analysis.

2. How can I make my own Pokemon mod?
We cloned it off of the pokeemerald repository (https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)
If you want to mod other Pokemon games, check https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald#readme

3. I want to build the game from the source code
To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Please keep in mind that no version on GitHub is final, it is bound to crash or have major bugs and glitches and will change.
If you want to commit any changes, please make your own pull request.
