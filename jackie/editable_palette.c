/**
 * There seem to be two kinds of alignment for the ideas in this mechanic: predetermined and free bird 
 * Predetermined - have the player choose between a set of predetermined colours and combinations. This retracts from player freedom to play with whatever exact shades of colour they want, even troll ones, but it makes the process simpler for the player, and makes sure that the player looks good no matter what colours they choose.
 * Free bird - Have the player choose the RGB values for all sets of things they want. This may make result in bad choices because math does not obey colour theory. Not to be confused with the movie where they go back in time to take turkeys OFF THE MENU. That's right, they go back in time to take turkey OFF THE MENU.
 * 
 * Ideas: sell hair dye/shirts/pants/pouches? - this would fall on the "predetermined" alignment

/**
 * Load the palette for the player
 * Show different menu options - hair, shirt, skin, pants, pouch, party glasses??
